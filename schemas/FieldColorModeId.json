  "description": "Color mode for a field. You can specify a single color, or select a continuous (gradient) color schemes, based on a value.\nContinuous color interpolates a color using the percentage of a value relative to min and max.\nAccepted values are:\n`thresholds`: From thresholds. Informs Grafana to take the color from the matching threshold\n`palette-classic`: Classic palette. Grafana will assign color by looking up a color in a palette by series index. Useful for Graphs and pie charts and other categorical data visualizations\n`palette-classic-by-name`: Classic palette (by name). Grafana will assign color by looking up a color in a palette by series name. Useful for Graphs and pie charts and other categorical data visualizations\n`continuous-GrYlRd`: ontinuous Green-Yellow-Red palette mode\n`continuous-RdYlGr`: Continuous Red-Yellow-Green palette mode\n`continuous-BlYlRd`: Continuous Blue-Yellow-Red palette mode\n`continuous-YlRd`: Continuous Yellow-Red palette mode\n`continuous-BlPu`: Continuous Blue-Purple palette mode\n`continuous-YlBl`: Continuous Yellow-Blue palette mode\n`continuous-blues`: Continuous Blue palette mode\n`continuous-reds`: Continuous Red palette mode\n`continuous-greens`: Continuous Green palette mode\n`continuous-purples`: Continuous Purple palette mode\n`shades`: Shades of a single color. Specify a single color, useful in an override rule.\n`fixed`: Fixed color mode. Specify a single color, useful in an override rule.",
